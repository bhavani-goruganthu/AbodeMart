### Issue Description
Given the situation we are in, several individuals do not prefer riding out to stores where there is public. Trying to find time to grocery shopping in day-to-day busy schedules is very hard. People are leaning towards online shopping saving both time and money. What if there can be a solution not just for an individual resident, but an entire community for the chosen groceries be delivered to their doorstep?

### Solution:
This application provides an online grocery delivery solution for residents of a small community. It is a one stop solution for grocery delivery from multiple stores. Members must sign up before they can order. Products can be ordered from 3 stores on a selected weekday. Community manager will be able to login and manage the orders from the members.

Project Title: “Abode Mart”
Abode signifies a place of residence and Mart is short for market.
